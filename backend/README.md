# setting up dev container
this website helped understanding, but in the end the tutorial is not needed since devcontainer extension will guide the user through setting it up step by step
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container

just install "dev containers", call the command "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" and follow the instructions to create a new setup. 

the ./devcontainer/devcontainer.json needs to be at the root of the directory and there can be only one. That's why I saved a duplicate with my backend config as devcontainer.backend.json. If you need your own configuration, delete the devcontainer.json and call the "reopen in container" command and let it prompt you through creating one. I suggest you also keep a copy of your config saved.

to install dependencies run `npm install` which is accessing package-lock.json in the root of the repository. then it is set up.

when running in school it needs to run as root, so if something fails when opening the dev container, try going to devcontainer.json and uncomment `"remoteUser": "root"` (and add a comma to the previous statement).

# fastify
after setting up the dev container you can try running `node backend/app.js`. This will start the server on http://localhost:3000/ . from your terminal you can type some curl commands to call the API.


## users routes
```
# Get all users
curl http://localhost:3000/users

# Get single user by ID
curl http://localhost:3000/users/1

# Create new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com", "passwordString":"abcdef124"}'

# Update user 
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@newmail.com", "passwordString":"newpw123432"}'

# Delete user (NOT IN USE ATM)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/1

# Login as user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alice@example.com", "passwordString":"abcdef124"}'
```

## profiles routes
```
# Get all profiles
curl http://localhost:3000/profiles

# Get profile by ID
curl http://localhost:3000/profiles/1

# Update entire profile per id (all fields required)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/profiles/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"nickname":"John Smith", "bio":"something about my life", "profilePictureUrl":"https://www.mypage.com/picture.jpeg"}'


```

# sqlite
after running fastify2.js you can see that pong.db was created. You can access it with `sqlite3 pong.db` and run something like `SELECT * FROM users;`
