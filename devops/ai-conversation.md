### 1. **Following Official Documentation Is Not Plagiarism**

- **Using Official Docs:**  
    Using the official Elastic documentation to set up a secure, production-ready ELK stack is not plagiarism. It is expected and encouraged to follow vendor documentation for correct and secure configuration, especially for complex systems like Elasticsearch.
- **Not a Turnkey Solution:**  
    The Docker Compose file from Elastic is a _reference implementation_ for secure deployment, not a “one-click” solution for your whole project. You still need to understand, adapt, and integrate it into your broader system.

### 2. **Project Rules and the Compose File**

- **Does Not Solve the Whole Module:**  
    The Compose file automates certificate generation and secure cluster setup, but it does not provide dashboards, log shipping, alerting, or application integration. You must still:
    - Ship logs from your app(s) to Elasticsearch (e.g., with Filebeat, Logstash, or custom code).
    - Configure Kibana dashboards and access controls.
    - Integrate authentication with your organization’s requirements.
    - Possibly set up network-level security (firewalls, reverse proxies, etc.).
- **You Still Need to Justify:**  
    If asked, you can explain that:
    - Security is a core requirement of modern ELK deployments.
    - The Compose file is a starting point, not a finished solution.
    - You have learned and can explain each part of the Compose file and the security measures it implements.

### 3. **What Else Is Needed for ELK Security?**

- **Network Security:**  
    Restrict access to Elasticsearch and Kibana to trusted networks or via VPN/reverse proxy.
- **User Management:**  
    Set up users, roles, and permissions in Elasticsearch/Kibana.
- **Audit Logging:**  
    Enable and configure audit logs if required.
- **TLS Everywhere:**  
    Ensure all connections (including Beats/Logstash) use TLS.
- **Secrets Management:**  
    Store passwords and certificates securely (not in plaintext or public repos).
- **Monitoring:**  
    Monitor the health and security of your ELK stack.

---

### 4. **Academic Integrity**

- **Be Transparent:**  
    Document in your project report/readme that you followed the official Elastic documentation for secure deployment, and explain any adaptations you made.
- **Demonstrate Understanding:**  
    Be prepared to explain each part of the Compose file and why it’s needed for security.

---

### **Summary**

- **You are not cheating** by following the official Elastic documentation for secure setup.
- **You are fulfilling the project’s security requirements** by using a secure, recommended approach.
- **You must still do significant work** to integrate, configure, and secure the ELK stack for your project’s needs.

If you can explain what each part of the Compose file does and how it contributes to security, you are demonstrating both understanding and compliance with your school’s rules.
